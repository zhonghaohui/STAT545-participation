## _Outline_

In this document, we are going to do some data exploration with the `gapminder` dataset.

### Load Packages

In order to access the `gapminder` dataset, we need to load the `gapminder` package.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

By executing the following chunks, we will be able to have some basic ideas of the `gapminder` dataset.

* What does this dataset contain?

Obtaining such information can be done by checking out the description excerpt of the dataset 
```{r}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
